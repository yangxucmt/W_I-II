# $W^{I/II}$ code
This code is based on the algorithm in https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.165112. Note that this code works for a general lattice, especially for the case of the effective chain approximating an infinite Hamiltonian, c.f. https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.86.245107.
